The IPFS Implementations Grants program exists to advance the development, growth, and impact of the IPFS project
through a focus on developer choice and availability. We provide financial support to projects and teams working to
make IPFS accessible to more developer communities.

We recently ran [the Spring 2025 grant cycle for utilities](https://ipfsgrants.io/utility-grants/), which supports
developers creating essential utilities, libraries, and tooling. It was a tight competition with strong contenders
and we're delighted with the grantees who came out of this round.

## rsky-satnav from Rudy Fraser, BlackSky

If you're anywhere near work on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) then you surely know Rudy, among other things for his
work on [BlackSky](https://www.blackskyweb.xyz/) and the [rsky](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky)
(say "risky") projects.

The grant will go to [rsky-satnav](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky/tree/main/rsky-satnav) (Structured
Archive Traversal, Navigation And Verification â€” we do appreciate a quality acronym), a local-first and user-friendly
[CAR](https://dasl.ing/car.html) explorer for AT Protocol.

CAR archives are a very convenient part of the IFPS ecosystem, used to package up multiple CID-addressed resources
in one bundle, and AT Protocol PDSs rely on them for data exports. But end users, even technical ones, have found
dealing with CAR files challenging due to a lack of tooling. We really look forward to playing with rsky-satnav
ourselves!

## CAR indexing from Ben Lau, Starling Lab

Another issue with CAR files is that they are as diverse as the data usecases and ergonomics of the IPFS ecosystem:
while Filecoin uploading returns a CAR file, it sidesteps the UnixFS and thus most CAR tooling cannot reconstruct or
navigate its contents. As these big-data archive files are not introspectable with UnixFS tools, Lau's team is open-sourcing
some indexing tools they created internally which create a _private index_ of Filecoin uploads, rounding out a historic
tooling/interop gap in the ecosystem.

Ben and team at [Starling Lab](https://starlinglab.org/) are developing a browser-based tool to help
locate the content of [Filecoin CAR archives](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_files/piece/), without relying on
public indexing services. This is a stepping stone to more general solutions for indexing. It's definitely going to
boost that part of the ecosystem!

And beyond that, stay tuned: we will have more annoucements coming.
