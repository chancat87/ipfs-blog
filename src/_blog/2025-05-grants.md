The IPFS Implementations Grants program exists to advance the development, growth, and impact of the IPFS project through a focus on developer choice and availability. We provide financial support to projects and teams working to make IPFS accessible to more developer communities.

We recently ran [the Spring 2025 grant cycle for utilities](https://ipfsgrants.io/utility-grants/), which supports developers creating essential utilities, libraries, and tooling for the IPFS ecosystem. It was a tight competition with strong contenders and we're delighted with the grantees who came out of this round.

## rsky-satnav CAR Explorer from Rudy Fraser, BlackSky

If you're anywhere near work on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) then you surely know Rudy Fraser, among other things for his work on [BlackSky](https://www.blackskyweb.xyz/) and the [rsky](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky) (say "risky") projects.

The grant will go to [rsky-satnav](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky/tree/main/rsky-satnav) (Structured Archive Traversal, Navigation And Verification — we do appreciate a quality acronym), a local-first and user-friendly [CAR](https://dasl.ing/car.html) explorer for AT Protocol.

CAR archives are a very convenient part of the IFPS ecosystem, used to package up multiple CID-addressed resources in one bundle, and AT Protocol PDSs rely on them for data exports. But end users, even technical ones, have found dealing with CAR files challenging due to a lack of tooling. We really look forward to playing with rsky-satnav ourselves!

## CAR Indexing from Ben Lau, Basile Simon, and Yurko Jaremko, Starling Lab

Another issue with CAR files is that they are as diverse as the data usecases and ergonomics of the IPFS ecosystem: while Filecoin uploading returns a CAR file, it sidesteps the UnixFS and thus most CAR tooling cannot reconstruct or navigate its contents. As these big-data archive files are not introspectable with UnixFS tools, the [Starling Lab](https://starlinglab.org/) team is open-sourcing some indexing tools they created internally which create a _private index_ of Filecoin uploads, rounding out a historic tooling/interop gap in the ecosystem.

Ben, Basile, and Yurko are developing a browser-based tool to help locate contents within [Filecoin CAR archives](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_files/piece/), without relying on public indexing services. This is a stepping stone to more general solutions for CAR indexing. It's definitely going to boost that part of the ecosystem!

## DASL Testing from Cole Anthony Capilongo, Hypha Worker Co-operative

Not all heroes wear capes, many of the cooler ones write tests. Tests are important in development, but they are particularly important when you're creating interoperable standards. The difference between a standard and a random piece of paper isn't that the standard was blessed by a special standards organization — there are plenty of worthlessly blessed pieces of paper out there — but rather that the standard has a comprehensive test suite passed by multiple independent production-quality implementations.

With this in mind, we're excited to also support [Cole Anthony Capilongo](https://hypha.coop/people/#Cole%20Anthony%20Capilongo) (from the mighty [Hypha](https://hypha.coop/) working on a test suite for [DASL](https://dasl.ing/)'s [dCBOR42](https://dasl.ing/dcbor42.html) (an interoperable subset of IPLD for deterministic data encoding) and [CIDs](https://dasl.ing/cid.html) (a usable subset of IPFS CIDs). Cole will exercise the tests against multiple implementations and help us fix bugs in the specifications too. It's going to be fan<em>test</em>ic.

And beyond that, stay tuned: we will have more annoucements coming.
