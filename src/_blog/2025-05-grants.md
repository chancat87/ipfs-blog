The IPFS Implementations Grants program exists to advance the development, growth, and impact of the IPFS project
through a focus on developer choice and availability. We provide financial support to projects and teams working to
make IPFS accessible to more developer communities.

We recently ran [the Spring 2025 grant session for utilities](https://ipfsgrants.io/utility-grants/), which supports
developers creating essential utilities, libraries, and tooling. It was a tight competition with strong contenders
and we're delighted with the grantees who came out of this round.

## rsky-satnav from Rudy Fraser

If you're anywhere near work on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) then you surely know Rudy, among other things for his
work on [BlackSky](https://www.blackskyweb.xyz/) and the [rsky](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky)
(say "risky") projects.

The grant will go to [rsky-satnav](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky/tree/main/rsky-satnav) (Structured
Archive Traversal, Navigation And Verification â€” we do appreciate a quality acronym), a local-first and user-friendly
[CAR](https://dasl.ing/car.html) explorer for AT Protocol.

CAR archives are a very convenient part of the IFPS ecosystem, used to package up multiple CID-addressed resources
in one bundle, and AT Protocol PDSs rely on them for data exports. But end users, even technical ones, have found
dealing with CAR files challenging due to a lack of tooling. We really look forward to playing with rsky-satnav
ourselves!

## CAR indexing from Ben Lau

Another issue with CAR is indexing: storing a CAR archive with a given service may make it challenging to
discover its contents the archive is treated as an opaque blob.

Ben and team at [Starling Lab](https://starlinglab.org/) are developing a browser-based tool to help
locate the content of CAR archives, without relying on public indexing services. It's definitely going to
boost that part of the ecosystem!

And beyond that, stay tuned: we will have more annoucements coming.
